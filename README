iams - Inter-Application Messaging System

Written as a test for Partheon.

Tracking my train of thought in this file for design.

Initial design (before writting any code) is to use Python and use its socket functionality, using JSON for the serialization allowing for an ID to be sent along with the message. 
Going to have the recieving application send a message in acknowledgement and verify that a message is only acted on if the ID has timed out. 
Going to use a standard queue for storing messages until they are acknowledged as recieved. 
Test does not specify whether the app can/should be multithreaded, considering using stackless to allow for using channels to communication between the coroutines which would make recieving messages a lot more certain. That or just have the messaging object checked on as part of a event loop style.
